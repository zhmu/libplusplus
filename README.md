# libplusplus

During the development of [IL/Jukebox](https://github.com/zhmu/il-jukebox), I found that a lot of the basic networking functionality originally written for [Frommel](https://github.com/zhmu/frommel) needed to be duplicated. Rather than to duplicate the code, I decided it would be more useful to put this functionality in a seperate library. This resulted in _lib++_, or _libplusplus_

## Features

lib++ provides the following functionality:

 * Portable: known to work on FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris<
 * Networking: support for client/server IPv4 applications, IPX (FreeBSD only)
 * Databases: uniform support to MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases
 * Configuration: support for parsing standard INI-like configuration files
 * Examples: nice collection of examples to get you going

## Downloads

 * [lib++ version 1.0](releases/libplusplus-1.0.tar.gz) (320KB)
 * [lib++ FreeBSD port](releases/libplusplus-port.tar.gz) (320KB)
